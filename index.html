<h1>Heuristic Evaluation of Twitter</h1>

<h2>1. Visibility of System Status</h2>

<p>
    Twitter provides appropriate feedback to users, constantly letting the user know and understand
    what is going on. An example of this happening is when a user is drafting a tweet. As the user
    types, a small circle appears near the "Tweet" button that allows the user to see how much space
    in a tweet they have used from the alotted amount.

<h2>2. Match Between System and the Real World</h2>

<p>
    Twitter sucessfully provides common words that a user recognizes, rather than using technological
    terms used by the computer. Phrases that are common in the social media world are shown throughout
    the website. "Messages," "Followed," "Profile," and "Home" are a few words that are utilized
    to direct the user.
</p>

<h2>3. User Control and Freedom</h2>

<p>
    Twitter supports "undo" options in case a user clicks on something that they either changed their
    mind about or did not mean to click. When a user is drafting a tweet, there include options to
    attach a photo, gif, poll, emoji, etc. However, if one of these choices are accidentally clicked
    on, users have a clear option to get rid of this action.

<h2>4. Consitency and Standards</h2>

<p>
    Users can understand that different actions do different things. When a user stumbles upon a tweet
    that suits them or that they enjoy, four actions are available: look at replies, retweet, like, or
    share the tweet outside of the app/website. To make the difference between each action more
    obvious, the main two actions (retweet or like) are expressed with different colors.
</p>

<h2>5. Error Prevention</h2>

<p>
    To prevent the risk of errors, Twitter understands that "retweeting" something can be important
    for a users profile. When a user prompts a retweet, the user is given two options: to simply
    retweet, or to retweet with a comment. This option provides a second step before the user commits
    to retweeting.
</p>

<h2>6. Recognition Rather than Recall</h2>

<p>
    As a user makes their way around Twitter, there are specific sections of the app/website
    that will always be available so that the user understands where they need to go for a
    specific task. The "Home," "Explore," "Notifications," "Messages," etc. apps are constantly
    local for the user to be brought back to this general page.
</p>

<h2>7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h2>

<p>
    Frequent actions are easily accessible, as they are constantly provided no matter what page
    the user is currently on.
</p>

<h2>8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h2>

<p>
    The minimalist design of Twitter allows users to scroll with ease to view tweets, rather than
    unnecessary information. Under each tweet are options to: look at replies, retweet, like, or
    share the tweet outside of the app/website. That being said, a small icon is used to represent
    each of these actions. This provides a small and simple design versus a clutter of words.

<h2>9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</h2>
