<h1>Heuristic Evaluation of Twitter</h1>

<h2>1. Visibility of System Status</h2>

<p>
    Twitter provides appropriate feedback to users, constantly letting the user know and understand
    what is going on. An example of this happening is when a user is drafting a tweet. As the user
    types, a small circle appears near the "Tweet" button that allows the user to see how much space
    in a tweet they have used from the alotted amount.
